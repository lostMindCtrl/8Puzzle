# 8Puzzle
My solution for the 8 Puzzle Assignment of the Algorithms course COS226 from Princeton University by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
In order to achieve the goal to solve the 8 Puzzle Problem, the A* search algorithm was utilized. Additionally, an effective solution to solve the Inversion Problem, which is needed to detect an input board's solvability, is used. The Approach applies a  slightly alteredMerge Sort algorithm which counts the Inversions of a given Board. 
<h3>Usage</h3>
The program works by using the Solver.java file and the syntax is: "Solver puzzle0.txt" - The program does not consider files in its root directory, 
it only looks for files in PuzzleData/ (think of it as the root directory).
